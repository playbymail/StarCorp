#summary Starship Design
#labels Phase-Design

= Introduction =

Starships are built to preconfigured designs.  These designs are made by [Corporations] using the StarshipDesigner, specifying which StarshipHulls.  

The design of a ship determines its function and capabalities for different tasks.  Some restrictions and requirements go into designing ships.  Some types of StarshipHulls are necessary to perform basic tasks such as movement.

= Command =

Every starship needs at least 1 Command Deck to function.

= Crew =

For every 3 other StarshipHulls, 1 Crew Deck is required for the starship to function.

= Cargo Space =

The MassUnits of items that can be put into a starship is determined by the total of the cargo capacity of its StarshipHulls.  Some cargo capacity is specifically used for specific [Resources], TradeGoods, BuildingModules or StarshipHulls and cannot be used for other items.

= Gravity Restrictions =

The maximum orbit gravity a starship can handle is 5 / impulse speed. The maximum docking gravity a starship can handle is 3 / impulse speed.

= Impulse Speed =

The impulse speed of a starship is determined by the total MassUnits of its StarshipHulls / total thrust power of its StarshipHulls.

= Jump Range =

The jump range of a starship is determined by the highest available warp factor of its StarshipHulls.

= Mining =

  * To mine AsteroidFields a ship's design must contain a Mining Platform.
  * To mine GasFields a ship's design must contain a Gas Collector Field.

= Exploration =

  * To conduct a galaxy scan for new [StarSystem]s a starship's design must contain a Long Range Scanner.
  * To conduct a scan of a StarSystem a starship's design must contain a Short Range Scanner.
  * To conduct a probe of an asteroid or gas field a starship's design must contain a System Probe.
  * To conduct a probe of a planet a starship's design must contain a Planet Probe.
  * To find organics whilst prospecting a planetary map square, a starship's design must contain a Bio Lab.
  * To find complex minerals and metals whilst prospecting a planetary map square, a starship's design must contain a Physics Lab.
  * To find gases and water whilst prospecting a planetary map square, a starship's design must contain a Geo Lab.
