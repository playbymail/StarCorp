= Introduction =

Colonists living at [Colonies] are divided into PopulationClass types.  They are [Employment employed] at [Facilities] where they earn a salary from the facility owner.  They spend this salary on their [NeedsAndHappiness needs] which determines how happy they are.

Colony populations are independent of coporations and move between jobs within the same colony and [PopulationMigration migrate] between colonies if the circumstances merit.

New colonists are born and some may die (see BirthAndDeath) every turn.
