= Location =

A starship always resides at a fixed location on the game map.  Therefore, it has attributes describing which star system it is in, what location within the star system, a planet it is orbiting or landed upon, coordinates of a location upon the planet and a colony where it is docked.

= Time Units =

Each starship has a 100 TimeUnits after each game update to use in various actions that take time.  

= Cargo =

Starships have a maximum cargo capacity of different item types based on their cargo hulls.  Cargo onboard a ship can be sold to colony markets, delivered to a corporation's warehouse within a colony or jettisoned (and destroyed).
