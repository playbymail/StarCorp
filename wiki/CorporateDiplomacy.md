= Introduction =

Corporations may establish several states of relations with other corporations.

= Ally =

A corporation may declare another corporation its ally.  Any declarations of war by the ally or against the ally will be met with a declaration of war against the third-party.

Setting an alliance status doesn't necessarily mean it will be returned.  

= Defend =

A corporation may defend another corporation from attack.  Anyone which declares war on the defended corporation will be declared war upon.

= War =

A declaration of war means ships will engage in combat with ships of the other colony and the corporation will not buy market items from the target.  

An automatic declaration of war occurs when:
  * An ally declares war on another corporation.
  * An ally or defended corporation is attacked.
  * The corporation is attacked.

= Peace =

The default state between a corporation and all other corporations.  A corporation may unilaterally declare itself at peace with a corporation it has declared war upon.
