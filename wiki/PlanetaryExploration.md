= Introduction =

Starships may perform one of the following actions once when in orbit of a planet but may not move afterwards.

= Probe =

A starship may probe the entire planet to obtain its atmosphere type, its map detailing the terrain, a list of colonies on the planet and a list of the [Resources] found on the planet and average yield.

A probe takes 10 TimeUnits.

= Prospecting =

A starship may prospect a specific planetary map square to determine exact yields for [Resources] found there.

The types of [Resources] it will find will be limited by the availability of its labs (bio, physics and geo).
 
Prospecting takes 50 TimeUnits.
