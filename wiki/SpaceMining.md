= Introduction =

A starship fitted with Mining Platform may mine an AsteroidField and one fitted with a Gas Collector field may mine a GasField.

A starship cannot move after mining.  It must have enough cargo space to hold the items it mines or they are left on the asteroid / gas field.

Mining takes 50 TimeUnits.
