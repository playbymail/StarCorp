= Introduction =

The Colony Hub is a special facility type which provides the core of any colony.  Only one hub facility can exist in each colony and it is created by a landing [Starships starshp] in the act of founding the colony.  

The corporation that owns the colony hub acts as the colony [Government].  The hub's service charge is a fee levied on all market transactions at the colony.

  * 25 [CSR]

= Function / Efficiency =

== Colony Market Transactions ==

The number of transactions a colony can handle at its ColonyMarkets is determined by the current efficiency band of the hub:
  * 100%: Unlimited transactions
  * 75-99%: 100 transactions
  * 50-74%: 50 transactions
  * 25-49%: 25 transactions
  * 10-24%: 10 transactions
