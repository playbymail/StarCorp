## Planets
###summary Star System Entities: Planets
###labels Phase-Design

= Introduction =

Planets are entities orbiting a star system.  Some are habitable but most are inhospitable to life.

= Gravity Rating =

Planets have a gravity rating which limits the [Starships ships] that can orbit or dock on them.  

Gas Giants typically have a very high gravity and no planetary map.

= Atmosphere =

Each planet has a [AtmosphereType type of atmosphere] which determines how life-sustaining it is.

= Moons =

Some planets may orbit another planet thus making them a moon of the planet in question. 

= Planetary Map =

Each planet (except Gas Giants) has a 2-dimensional map where each square has its own [Terrain] and potentially a number of [Resources resource] deposits which can be gathered by suitable [Facilities facilities].

Each map square can contain a single [Colonies colony] and any number of [Starships ships] which have docked there.

## ColonyMarkets
###summary Colony Markets
###labels Phase-Design

= Introduction =

All [Colonies] have a market where items may be put on sale and bought by any corporation.  

= Selling =

Items must be located at the colony or on a starship either on the colony or interacting with the colony via an OrbitalDock.

A price per unit and quantity is specified when selling.  Items to be sold are removed from the corporation / starships inventory and added to the colony market.

= Buying =

Any listed item can be bought and either left in the colony or transported directly into a starship via an OrbitalDock.

When buying an item, the cheapest available item listed on the market is bought up to the quantity specified. [Credits] are transferred to the selling corporation upon sale.

## InterplanetaryMovement
###summary Interplanetary Movement
###labels Phase-Design

= Introduction =

Movement on a [StarSystem]s map is done at impulse speed (see StarshipDesign).  

The impulse speed determines the TimeUnits it takes for a ship to move from quadrant or orbit to the adjacent one.



 
 

## StarshipDesign
###summary Starship Design
###labels Phase-Design

= Introduction =

Starships are built to preconfigured designs.  These designs are made by [Corporations] using the StarshipDesigner, specifying which StarshipHulls.  

The design of a ship determines its function and capabalities for different tasks.  Some restrictions and requirements go into designing ships.  Some types of StarshipHulls are necessary to perform basic tasks such as movement.

= Command =

Every starship needs at least 1 Command Deck to function.

= Crew =

For every 3 other StarshipHulls, 1 Crew Deck is required for the starship to function.

= Cargo Space =

The MassUnits of items that can be put into a starship is determined by the total of the cargo capacity of its StarshipHulls.  Some cargo capacity is specifically used for specific [Resources], TradeGoods, BuildingModules or StarshipHulls and cannot be used for other items.

= Gravity Restrictions =

The maximum orbit gravity a starship can handle is 5 / impulse speed. The maximum docking gravity a starship can handle is 3 / impulse speed.

= Impulse Speed =

The impulse speed of a starship is determined by the total MassUnits of its StarshipHulls / total thrust power of its StarshipHulls.

= Jump Range =

The jump range of a starship is determined by the highest available warp factor of its StarshipHulls.

= Mining =

  * To mine AsteroidFields a ship's design must contain a Mining Platform.
  * To mine GasFields a ship's design must contain a Gas Collector Field.

= Exploration =

  * To conduct a galaxy scan for new [StarSystem]s a starship's design must contain a Long Range Scanner.
  * To conduct a scan of a StarSystem a starship's design must contain a Short Range Scanner.
  * To conduct a probe of an asteroid or gas field a starship's design must contain a System Probe.
  * To conduct a probe of a planet a starship's design must contain a Planet Probe.
  * To find organics whilst prospecting a planetary map square, a starship's design must contain a Bio Lab.
  * To find complex minerals and metals whilst prospecting a planetary map square, a starship's design must contain a Physics Lab.
  * To find gases and water whilst prospecting a planetary map square, a starship's design must contain a Geo Lab.

## AtmosphereType

## StellarAnomoly
###summary Stellar Anomoly
###labels Phase-Design

= Introduction =

Stellar Anomoly are strange and unique features in space.  Each is different in what effect it has on passing [Starships].  

## Population
###summary Colony Populations
###labels Phase-Design

= Introduction =

Colonists living at [Colonies] are divided into PopulationClass types.  They are [Employment employed] at [Facilities] where they earn a salary from the facility owner.  They spend this salary on their [NeedsAndHappiness needs] which determines how happy they are.

Colony populations are independent of coporations and move between jobs within the same colony and [PopulationMigration migrate] between colonies if the circumstances merit.

New colonists are born and some may die (see BirthAndDeath) every turn.
 

## ClientApplication
###summary Client Application
###labels Phase-Requirements,Phase-Design

The client is a Java / SWT application which performs the following functions:

  * Load turn report
  * View turn report
  * Search colony markets
  * Search available leases and grants
  * Design starships
  * Prepare turn orders
  * Submit turn orders

= Main Window =

The main app window consists of a two column panes: a tree explorer (LHS) for navigating through the turn report and a data panel (RHS) for viewing details of entities within the report.

== Toolbar ==

The app window has a toolbar with the following buttons:
  * Load turn report
  * New turn
  * Search items
  * Search markets
  * Search leases and grants
  * Design Starship

== Menu ==

The app window has a menu for quickly accessing certain functions (keyboard shortcuts in brackets):

    * Search market (F6)
    * Search items (F7)
    * Search leases and grants (F8)
  * Help
    * About
    

== Tree Browser ==

The tree browser is structured like the turn report:

  * Corporation - loads player's corporation data pane
  * Turn Report 
    * Orders - each sub-node links to a report for a specific order committed in the last turn.
  * Entities
    * Ships - sub-nodes link to ship data pane for that starship
    * Facilities - sub-nodes link to facility data pane for that facilities

== Entity Data Pane ==

The entity data pane changes the displayed information based on what has been selected in the tree browser or via a hyperlink in an order report.

  * Order Report - displays the order given, the text message of success / failure and a list of any scanned entities, each hyperlinked to reload the data pane.
  * Generic Entity - displays specified fields and values for that entity (e.g. ID, name, location etc.)
  * Planet - planets will display data about the planet and a grid map of the planet map (if available)

== Load turn report ==

Opens a file browser (initially set to current working directory / reports) to pick up the report file which is then loaded and parsed. 

= Turn Order Window =

The turn order window has two horizontal components:
  * Order Builder
  * Current Orders

== Order Builder ==

Consists of a drop down of the orders available, plus fields for entering values for the arguments.

The order fields will be text inputs or drop downs of suitable entities.

== Current Orders ==

This is an editable table of current orders with options to edit fields or delete rows.

= Search Colony Markets Window =

This consists of several drop downs to filter a table of matching market orders.  Filtering by:
  * Item type (drop-down)
  * Colony (drop-down)
  * Seller (drop-down)
  * Item category (e.g. Resource, Industrial Goods etc.) - filters item types too (drop-down)
  * Quantity (text input)
  * Price (text input)

= Search Colony Items Window =

This consists of several drop downs to filter a table of matching colony items.  Filtering by:
  * Item type (drop-down)
  * Colony (drop-down)
  * Item category (e.g. Resource, Industrial Goods etc.) - filters item types too (drop-down)

  * Facility type (drop-down)
  * Colony (drop-down)
  * Price / Value (text input)
  * Include Leases (checkbox)
  * Include Grants (checkbox)



 
 
 

## PopulationMigration
###summary Population Migration
###labels Phase-Design

= Introduction =

Unemployed colonists will migrate from their colony to another colony at the following rate each turn:

Happiness level of target colony PopulationClass - Happiness level of current colony PopulationClass

This level is modified by the distance away:
  * x 2 if on same planet
  * x 1 if on a planet in same star system location
  * / 2 if on a planet in same star system
  * / 5 if on a planet in different star system

The unemployed will move at this rate to colonies in the following order:
  * Colonies on same planet
  * Colonies in same star system location
  * Colonies in same star system
  * All other colonies

The migration percentage is applied to the total unemployed after each migration to a specific colony. e.g.

Assume the following scenario:
  * There are 100 unemployed technicians at colony A with a happiness level of 50%
  * Colony B on same planet has technician happiness of 80%
  * Colony C in same star system location happiness of 80%
  * Colony D in same star system has happiness of 90%
  * Colony E in a different star system has happiness of 80%

Migration would happen as follows:
  * Migration of Colony A to B: 30% x 2 = 60%. Migrants: 60. Remaining unemployed: 40.
  * Migration of Colony A to C: 30% x 1 = 30%. Migrants: 12. Remaining unemployed: 28.
  * Migration of Colony A to D: 40% / 2 = 20%. Migrants: 6. Remaining unemployed: 22.
  * Migration of Colony A to E: 30% / 5 = 6%. Migrants: 1. Remaining unemployed: 21.
 

## SpaceMining
###summary Space Mining
###labels Phase-Design

= Introduction =

A starship fitted with Mining Platform may mine an AsteroidField and one fitted with a Gas Collector field may mine a GasField.

A starship cannot move after mining.  It must have enough cargo space to hold the items it mines or they are left on the asteroid / gas field.

Mining takes 50 TimeUnits.

## TradeGoods
###summary Trade Goods

= Introduction =

Trade goods are made in factories from [Resources].  They are either given directly to consumers (ConsumerGoods) or used in further production at factories (IndustrialGoods).

Each trade good specifies the amount of different [Resources] required to produce 1 MassUnits of the good at a factory.

 

## Facilities
###summary Colony Facilities
###labels Phase-Design

= Introduction =

Facilities are immovable structures built within a colony that fall into the following categories:
  * ColonyHub
  * OrbitalDock
  * ServiceFacilities
  * [Factories]
  * ResourceGenerators

They are owned by a [Corporations corporation].

See also FacilityTypes.

= Building a facility =

To build a new facility at a colony a corporation must:
  * Own the appropriate FacilityLeases
  * Have the right number and type of BuildingModules at the colony

= Closing a facility =

A facility may be closed voluntary by its owner to avoid the cost of operating it in terms of power and employees (which are all fired). 

= Workers =

Facilities require a minimum number of [Population colonists] to operate at full efficiency.  They pay their workers a salary each turn, determined by the facility owner.  

Workers are automatically hired from the available pool of unemployed colonists at the colony.  They go to the facility paying the highest salary until the facility is full and then to the next highest paying and so on.

= Power =

In addition to workers all facilities require power to operate.  The amount of power required is determined by the type of facility.  If the facility doesn't meet its power requirements it operates at 0% efficiency (ie. is shut down until it acquires power).

Power is a TradeGoods produced by [Factories] from suitable [Resources].  When using power a facility will first attempt to meet its requirement from the available stockpile owned by the corporation at the colony.  If there is insufficient enough power in the corporation's private stockpile, the facility will automatically attempt to buy it on the ColonyMarkets for that colony at the cheapest available price.

= Service Charges =

Some facility types allow the owner to set a charge level (in credits) for their usage.

  * ColonyHub facilities service charge is per market transaction on the ColonyMarkets.
  * OrbitalDock facilities service charge is per market transaction via orbit
  * ServiceFacilities service charge is per colonist using it (see NeedsAndHappiness)
  * Factories and ResourceGenerators do no use a service charge.
 
 
 

## TurnProcessor
###summary Server Turn processor
###labels Phase-Design

= Introduction =

The TurnProcessor reads turn files from the turns directory (fetched using the TurnFetcher) and processes them individually.  It will authenticate the player based on the supplied credentials in the turn and registers new players if the email address provided is not already on the system.

Once done processing the turn it emails the turn report to the player.

## Colonies
###summary Colonies
###labels Phase-Design

= Introduction =

Colonies are entities representing settlements on a [PlanetsAndAsteroids planet] containing one or more [Facilities].  They are [Government governed] by the founding [Corporations corporation].

= Creating a new colony =

Colonies are founded when a [Starships starship] lands on a planet's surface with the requisite BuildingModules to create a ColonyHub facility.

## SpaceCombat
###summary Space Combat Engine
###labels Phase-Design

= Introduction =

_Space Combat is not a definite feature and certainly won't be for 1.0 release. These are some preliminary ideas however_

The Space Combat Engine handles combat between two star ships. 

= New Starship Hulls =

== Weapons ==

Weapons are fired during combat to cause damage to the opposing ship. Weapons have several attributes:

  * Type: either mass, energy or radiation.
  * Accuracy: the accuracy rating is base chance to hit the target with the weapon.
  * Rate Of Fire: The number of combat rounds before each time the weapon can be fired.
  * Damage: The amount of damage done on a successful hit.
  * Special Damage Type: may be one of the following:
    * Kill Crew
    * Disable Impulse
    * Disable Warp
    * Disable Shields
    * Disable Weapons
  * Special Damage Chance: chance the weapon's special damage occurs upon a successful hit.
  * Ammo Type: if set the ship will need to consume 1 of the type specified (held in the ship's cargo) each time it fires.  If none available, the weapon will not fire.

== Shields / Armour ==

Shields and armour add to a ship's shield factor in each of the weapon types (mass, energy or radiation).  Shield attributes:
  * Type: either mass, energy or radiation
  * Total: total value of the shield / armour.
  * Restore Rate: the amount of the value restored to the ship's shield factor each round of combat.

== Countermeasures ==

Countermeasures make certain types of weapons less effective against the ship using them.  Countermeasures have the following attributes:

  * Weapon Type: the type of weapon they counter.
  * Effectiveness: the chance of countering a successful hit from weapons of this type.

== Marine Barracks ==

Marine barracks on ships allow a ship to board opposing ships.

== Repair ==

Repair hulls allow a ship to repair damage or remove special flags placed upon them.  Repair hulls have the following attributes:
  * Effectiveness: The number of MUs of damage they repair each usage.
  * Special: Any flags they remove from the starship.

= New Facility Types =

== Repairyard ==

= Starship Changes =

== Hull Damage ==

Each starship will track the total damage taken by them from combat.  Damage can be repaired but if it equals or exceeds the ships total hull mass, the ship is destroyed.

== Shield Factor ==

Each starship has a shield factor which is the amount of damage is absorbed from weapons.  

Shield Factor is split into three categories (similar to weapons):
  * Energy
  * Mass
  * Radiation

Shield factor is equal to the total shield factors of all suitable hulls.  It is reset to full each update, unless the ship's shields have been disabled.

== Starship Flags ==

Starships will need flags to denote special conditions placed upon them by combat.  The default is NONE (denoting no special circumstances).  Other valid flags:

  * IMPULSE_IMMOBILIZED - cannot move, orbit, leave orbit or dock.
  * WARP_IMMOBILIZED - cannot jump
  * WEAPONS_DISABLED - cannot fire weapons
  * SHIELDS_DISABLED - cannot regerenate shields
  * CREW_MINIMAL - all TU costing actions take twice as long
  * CREW_NONE - cannot perform any actions

= Starship Actions =

== Repair Ship Hulls ==

If a repair hull is fitted, the ship will attempt to repair itself or a ship in the same location.  TU Cost: 20.

== Resupply Crew ==

The ship will resupply a ship with its own crew, removing the CREW_NONE flag but giving both ships the CREW_MINIMAL flag.

== Board Ship ==

If a ship has a marine barracks hull will board a ship with a CREW_NONE flag, Boarded ships take on new owners but remain in the same state (ie. damage and flags remain).

== Destroy Derelict ==

= Starship Combat Preferences =

Each starship has a number of preferences which determines whether it will initiate combat and what actions it will perform during combat:

  * Attack: Max Hull Size
  * Attack: Max Impulse Speed
  * Target: Hull type (command, engine, cargo, any)
  * Flee: Percentage of damage before attempting to flee combat

= Trigger =

Combat is triggered when a ship scans another ship on its hate list (see CorporateDiplomacy) that is not excluded by virtue of its combat preferences.

= Combat Rounds =

Combat is fought in rounds with each round the ship with the lowest (best) impulse speed going first.  

== Fire Weapons ==

A weapon is available if its rate of fire determines it is and the ship doesn't have a WEAPONS_DISABLED flag.  If the weapon uses ammo 1 of the specified type must be in the ship's cargo.

The chance to hit with the weapon is:

  * Accuracy - (100 / Impulse Speed) %

If the weapon hits:
  * Ammo of the type used is removed from cargo.
  * Any suitable countermeasures are tested to see if they nullify the hit.
  * Normal damage is applied of the weapon's type to:
    * The Shield Factor if it is greater than the weapon's damage
    * Any remaining damage is applied to the ship's hulls
  * Special damage effects (if any) are checked for.

== Restore Shields ==

Shields attempt to restore shield factors based on their Restore Rating.

== Flee ==

The chance a ship will attempt to flee is equal to:

  * (Hull Damage / Total Hull Mass) x 100% vs Flee Comat Preference

If the ship is not IMPULSE_IMMOBILISED it will attempt to flee.  The chance of successfully fleeing combat:
  * (Fleeing Ship's Impulse Speed / Pursuing Ship's Impulse Speed) x 100%

## NonPlayerCorporationProcessor
###summary Non-Player Corporation (NPC) Prcessor
###labels Phase-Design

= Introduction =

The NPC Processor brings to life NPCs by making them do some actions with their various entities.  Initially, this will not be very intelligent but later it should be possibly to put some decision making into the process or even AI.

At this point NPCs are assumed not to have starships.

= Factories =

If their production queue is empty NPC factories will have items they can produce queued.

For light and heavy factories the exact items queued will be based on the available resources at the colony.  

Super-heavy factories have a building modules of each type added to their queue as well.

Shipyards have all the types of starship hulls added to their queue.

If a light or heavy factory has no suitable items in their queue, it will be shut down to save power.

= Markets =

NPCs will sell any consumer goods, building modules or starship hulls in their inventory on the market at 10% higher than the average price available (or a preset value if none are available).

They will also sell any resources and industrial goods in excess of 100 on the market.

They will attempt buy items listed on the colony market to meet any raw materials requirements of items queued in their factories.

= Introduction =

Star Corp is a play-by-email game set in space where you control a corporation with free reign to explore and exploit the resources of countless worlds.

[Screenshots]

= Getting Started =

To start playing [http://starcorp.googlecode.com/files/StarCorp%20Client-Installer%200.9.1.0.exe download the client installer].  Once [Install installed], choose File -> New Account from the menu.  You will be [http://starcorp.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/screenshots/credentials_dialog.png prompted] for information about your new setup:

  * Corporation - give your corporation a suitable name
  * Name - enter the name you want other players to know you by
  * Email - enter a valid email address to receive turn reports.  This email is also displayed to other players so they can contact you.
  * Password - enter a memorable password for your account.

Once the account details are entered you will be [http://starcorp.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/screenshots/email_configration.png prompted] one time for details about your email server for sending emails:

  * Host - hostname for your SMTP server. e.g. smtp.gmail.com
  * Username - your email account username.
  * Password - your email account password.
  * Port - the port of your SMT server. e.g. 21

Once your email account details are configured, an email will be sent to the Star Corp server and you will shortly receive your first turn report.

= Your First Turn Report =

Once you have received your first turn report, save it to a convenient location and open your Star Corp client.  The turn report will come in compressed zip format but there is no need to unarchive it as the client will happily read the file.  

Choose the "Open Report" button on the client or go File -> Load Report in the menu, navigate to where you saved the turn report and select open.

You will see a navigation tree on the left side of the client with details of your corporation, any starships and facilities you started with.  Take some time to review your initial position.

= Navigation =

You can select any point in the navigation tree for more detailed information which will be displayed on the right hand side.  You can also use the arrow buttons on the toolbar to return to a previously shown data window.

= Issuing Orders =

The [http://starcorp.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/screenshots/turn_window1.png Turn Order window] is where you can issue orders to your starships and facilities.  It can be accessed either via Turn -> Prepare on the menu, the New Turn button on the toolbar or via links in the data window from your controlled ships, facilities or governments.

The top of the Turn Order window displays a form for adding new orders to your current turn.  First you choose the order to be given, then it will allow you to pick suitable targets and enter other values pertaining to the order.  Once prepared press the "Add" button to add the order to the current list.

The bottom of the Turn Order window displays a table of prepared orders.  Any field here can be directly edited if needed.

Once your orders are ready you can press "Submit" to send your orders to the Star Corp server for processing.

= Your First Orders =

You will begin with at least one starship which can be used to explore your starting system.  Navigate to it in the [http://starcorp.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/screenshots/turn_report3.png main application window] using the navigation tree.  You will find it under Starships (as well as information about the [http://starcorp.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/screenshots/turn_report2.png ship's design]).

It will begin docked at a colony and so will first need to take off.  In the Starship's data pane there is a link to Take Off which will add a take off order to your current orders.  

Once the Turn Order window is open use the drop down to add a Probe Planet for your starship order to scan the currently orbiting planet.  

Then you should leave orbit and perform a Scan System order to obtain information about other planets, asteroids and gas fields in the current star system.  Finally, a Scan Galaxy system will report any nearby star systems and add their location to your databanks so your ships will be able to jump to them and you will receive market reports from them.

Once these simple orders have been issued, you should submit your turn and wait for your turn report.  

Remember, you can submit any number of turns in between game updates but your starships have a limited amount of time and most actions take some time to perform.

= Future Turns =

Star Corp is an open ended game and there are numerous possibilities and ways to play.  Its probably a good idea to set yourself some goals and work towards them.

== Exploration ==

Your starting ship is well suited to explore your starting and nearby star systems.  Exploration typically consists of:

  * *Scan System* for planets / asteroids / gas fields in the current system.
  * *Move* to the location of the planet / asteroid / gas field
  * *Probe System* on asteroids / gas fields to determine what resource deposits they contain.
  * *Orbit* a planet and then *Probe Planet* to find out more about the planet as well as get the planet's map.
  * *Dock* at different locations on the planet and *Prospect* to determine what resource deposits they contain.
  * *Scan Galaxy* for nearby star systems and *Jump* to them and repeat the process in an all new star system.

== Trading ==

Every turn you will be given a list of all items on sale in colony markets of systems you have knowledge of.  You can use the [http://starcorp.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/screenshots/search_market1.png Search Market window] to find specific items at specific locations.

Your corporation can buy items at any colony it knows about at any time.  Buying items from the market incurs a service charge per transaction from the government of the colony. Bought items are stored in a private warehouse until used, sold or shipped.  You can use the [http://starcorp.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/screenshots/search_items1.png Search Items window] to find items in your corporation's warehouses.

Your starships can carry a certain amount of items based on what cargo hulls they have fitted.  You can either pickup / deliver items directly from your own warehouses on each colony or interact directly with the market using your starship.  Additionally, if a colony has an [OrbitalDock Orbital Dock] you may trade with the colony (buy, sell, pickup or deliver) from orbit without having to land at the colony.

There are many trading strategies but they typically come down to buying something cheaper at one colony and shipping it to another where it can be sold at a higher price.  Finding and  setting up trade routes can be a challenging and rewarding experience.

Some advice on the various [Items item types] and typical demand:

  * [Resources] - extracted from planet's by farms, mines etc and by starships from asteroids / gas fields they are used in production by [Factories factories].  There is a lot of variation on what will be available on each [Planets planet] or [AsteroidField asteroid]/[GasField gas field].  All resources are used to make something else.  Trading resources typically involves buying them from far flung small colonies and shipping them to larger colonies with factories to turn them into useful goods.
  * [IndustrailGoods Industrial Goods] - built at heavy factories from resources these are used in further production.  Typically, smaller and medium colony's will produce these goods from available resources and sell them on their markets as they don't have the necessary larger factories or other components to make other items from them.  Buying them from these markets and shipping them to larger colonies is a viable money earner.
  * [ConsumerGoods Consumer Goods] - built at light factories they are an always in demand at colonies everywhere.  There are 4 categories and 3 quality levels of different consumer goods and each colonist at a colony will want to buy at least 1 of each category each game update.  If a colony's market doesn't have them or they can't afford to buy them, they will become unhappy. So supplying colony markets with consumer goods should keep any trader busy indefinitely as colonies will not necessarily be able to produce consumer goods locally.
  * [BuildingModules Building Modules] / [StarshipHulls Starship Hulls] - these are only useful to other players and require larger cargo hulls to carry.  They should be considered an advanced trading option once there you have established relationships with other corporations.

== Building new Starships ==

Soon you will want a second starship to expand your options of play.  The first step in building a starship is to design it.  Use the [http://starcorp.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/screenshots/design_ship1.png Design Ship window] (accessed from the main window's toolbar) to add hulls to a design in progress.  

Each hull adds certain capabilities to your starship design but will increase its overall mass and thus _increase_ its impulse speed (an increase in impulse speed means [# InterplanetaryMovement movement] will take longer and the levels of gravity the ship can handle are lower).  

Remember, each hull will have to be built or bought so tailoring the types of hulls in your design to those hulls you have or can get access to is a must.  For example, adding Warp V to your design when there are none available anywhere would make your design fairly useless (at least until you acquire Warp V hulls).

All ships need 1 command deck and 1 crew deck for every none command / crew deck.  The starship designer will automatically add crew decks to your design as you add other hulls.  Some form of engines for thrust and [InterstellarMovement jump movement] is necessary.  The type and quantity is up to you but monitor the design window to see what your impulse speed / jump rating is and what planet gravity's your design can handle.

It also makes sense to make your designs fit for a purpose:
  * A ship designed to trade should be fitted with suitable cargo hulls for the type of items you wish to trade.  
  * A ship designed for exploration should be fitted with scanners, probes and labs to allow it to Scan systems, probe planets / asteroids / gas fields and prospect a planet's surface.
  * A mining ship should be fitted with a Mining Platform (for mining asteroids) and / or a Gas Field Collector (for mining gas fields) and suitable cargo hulls for storing the mined resources.

When your design meets your requirements, give the design a name and press the Issue Design Order to have the design added to your current turns.  You will need to submit your turn and receive a successful report before you can use the design to build new ships using the design.

Once you've designed your ship you need to buy (or build) the appropriate hulls, gather them in a single colony and then issue a build ship order.  This will assemble the hulls needed for your design and create your new starship.  

== Asteroid / Gas Field Mining ==

A ship fitted with a Mining Platform or Gas Field Collector can mine asteroids and gas fields respectively.  This is a 50 TU action that can be performed when your mining ship is at the same location as the asteroid or gas field.  To determine what resources an asteroid / gasfield will produce each time it is mined you should use a ship fitted with a Probe to scan them.

Mined resources are put in your cargo hulls and you will only be able to mine as much as you can carry.

== Building new Facilities ==

Owning a facility will allow you to do own of the following:
  * Farms, Mines, Gas Plants, Liquid Pumps, Refineries: Gather resources from deposits located at a colony.
  * Light, Heavy, Super-Heavy Factories and Shipyards: Build items from resources.
  * Orbital Dock: Allow starships to trade with the colony market or their own warehouses from orbit (for a service charge).
  * Other: Provide services for colonists at a colony for a fee.

The first step in building a facility is acquiring a lease from the colony government.  These are put on sale and available leases can be found using the [http://starcorp.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/screenshots/search_laws1.png Search Laws window]. Each lease allows 1 of the specified type of facility to be built at the colony.

Its also a good idea to see if the colony government has issued a development grant for that facility type.  You can find them in the [http://starcorp.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/screenshots/search_laws1.png Search Laws window] as well.  A grant means you will be paid for building the specified type of facility.  You still need a suitable lease but it can offset the cost of the lease or even depending on the government's generosity the overall cost of building the facility.

Once you have a suitable lease, you need to buy the necessary building modules for the facility type and gather it at the colony.  Then you can issue a Build Facility order to construct your new facility.

After you have constructed a facility you should:
  * Set the salary you wish to pay each type of worker needed at your facility every game update.
  * Set a service charge if appropriate for your facility for colonists or ships to pay.
  * Issue build orders for your factories.

A newly built facility will begin with no employees and will hire from the available unemployed pool at the colony.  Depending on the colony, it may take a few updates to bring the number of employees to full capacity.  Also be aware employees will quit if their salary doesn't meet their living costs and some will die (a particular problem in high hazard level colonies).  The only control you have over your employees is how much you pay them, where you built the facility and how well stocked the colony market is with affordable consumer goods.  A facility's efficiency will suffer if it is not fully staffed.  This can mean lower capacity at factories, less resources gathered or less colonists / starships serviced.

To operate a facility will need to be powered.  There are various power [Items items] (made from factories from resources) and your facility will have a power requirement based on its type.  Each game update the facility will try to pick power from your colony warehouse or buy directly from the market to meet its need.  Failing that, it will remain unpowered.  Unpowered facilities do not gather resources, produce items or service colonists / starships.

Some further advice:
  * Leases and grants are a way for colony governments to limit or encourage growth at their colonies to meet certain demands from their colonists.  
  * Always prospect the colony's location before building resource gathering facilities.  No point building a farm if there are no organics in that location.
  * Build factories with a view of what they might produce based on available items at the colony.  For example: Building a shipyard in a remote colony with no easy access to suitable materials to build starship hulls is probably a bad idea.  However, a colony with coal and iron would be a good place to build factories to produce steel alloy.
  * Facilities that service colonists are a great way to earn a steady income.
  * Resource gathering is a great way to enter the production chain.  They can be sold directly on the colony's market, shipped to a more profitable location or saved and used in further production.  Plan which facilities produce with a view of moving from gathering to making simple industrial goods from a couple of gathered resources to building further complex items.

== Founding new Colonies ==

Once you've mastered running a number of ships and facilities, it might be time to try your hand at founding and running a colony.  The first step is to find a suitable location by exploring the star systems you know about and the planets they contain.

Some things to consider when picking a site for a new colony:
  * Obviously, a colony cannot be built in the same location as an existing colony.
  * The atmosphere of the planet determines its hazard level (determined by a Planet Probe).  The hazard level is the base for the number of colonists that will die each game update at the colony.  It is highly recommended to colonise Green or ideally Microbiotic atmosphere planets.  The former means no deaths from the atmosphere whilst the latter actually encourages growth!  A Thin atmosphere may be liveable enough if the planet contains something worth a few colonist deaths but other [AtmosphereType atmosphere types] will pretty much ensure your colony never takes off.
  * The planet's gravity rating will limit the ships that can trade with it so be wary of high gravity ratings.  A gravity rating of 1-3g is usually acceptable.
  * Once you have a planet map, pick locations on the planet's surface with different terrain types and prospect them to see what resources they have.  Each square of the map may contain different deposits with different yields so its probably worth the effort to prospect most or all of a planet to find an ideal location.
  * The type of resources available will heavily influence the expansion opportunities of your colony. A broad range of different resources will mean more items can be produced locally whilst a good yield of a rarer resource will mean specialisation and profit!
  * Do consider the [Terrain terrain] your colony will be built upon.
  * Also consider the location of the new colony to nearby colonies which can be used to supply it.  Having a clear idea where modules, consumer goods, power and other necessary items will be shipped from is important in planning a new colony.
  * Building colonies is expensive and best done with plenty of cooperation with other corporations.

Once a suitable location has been picked its time to load a starship with necessary modules to build a colony hub and send it to the location where you wish build the new colony.  Once docked, it issues a Found Colony order and gives the new colony a name.  Congratulations, you have built a new colony!

As governor of the new colony you can:
  * Issue leases to build new facilities.  You can restrict new leases so they are bought by yourself immediately.
  * Issue development grants to encourage or subsidize the production of a new facility.
  * Issue colonist grants to subsidize colonists at your colony so they can meet their needs and have a high happiness rating.  

Some advice in running a colony:
  * Early on your colony will need a lot of hands on development and trading.  Do not undertake this lightly!  Its likely you will have to devote all your efforts to building your colony sacrificing other avenues of expansion such as trade or production.
  * Attracting colonists to your colony is the only way to ensure your facilities (or those you allow to be built by others) are well staffed.  Meeting their needs is paramount.  Make sure the colony market is well stocked with consumer goods and you have sufficient facilities to service the colonists.  
  * Ship enough power to supply your facilities or they will remain idle.  Putting some on the colony market so other corporations have a reserve to draw upon for their facilities will make your colony more attractive to run a facility at.
  * Be prepared to subsidise development of new facilities.  If your focus is in gathering resources, outsourcing the facilities needed to keep your colonists happy might make more sense than trying to build everything yourself.  
  * Be careful with colonist grants.  Whilst probably necessary to keep a pool of unemployed colonists happy until facilities are built or to cover unusually high prices for consumer goods or services, they are a drain on your funds which would be better met by paying suitably high salaries at your facilities.

  * The colony is given enough population to run all facilities.
  * ServiceFacilities are added to meet current population needs.  Additional population is added to run these facilities.
  * The corporation is given enough power to run all facilities for 100 turns.
  * The colony market is given enough consumer needs for all colonists for 100 turns.

= Templates =

  * Outpost: 1-5 farms, 1-5 mines, 1-2 pumps, 1-2 refineries

## DevelopmentGrants
###summary Colony Development Grants

= Introduction =

Development grants can be given by colony [Government]s to encourage the building of [Facilities] at a colony.  They are a promise to pay a set number of [Credits] by the [Government] when a facility of a certain type is created at the colony.

An issued grant is automatically claimed and used when a facility of the right type is created.

An orbital dock uses 10 units of power per turn.

= Function / Efficiency =

== Colony Market Transactions ==

The number of transactions the dock can handle from orbit is determined by its current efficiency band:
  * 100%: 100000 transactions
  * 75-99%: 10000 transactions
  * 50-74%: 5000 transactions
  * 25-49%: 2500 transactions
  * 1-24%: 1000 transactions
  * 0%: 0 transactions
