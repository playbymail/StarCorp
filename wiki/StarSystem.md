= Introduction =

Star systems are entities representing stars and their orbiting bodies.

= Galactic Map Position =

Each star system is located at a point in the 3-dimensional galactic map.  Distance between star systems determines how powerful a starship's jump engines must be to travel directly to the system.

= Type =

Star systems are given descriptive type descriptions (from [http://www.enchantedlearning.com/subjects/astronomy/stars/startypes.shtml Astronomical Star Classifications]):

  * Dwarf
  * Yellow Dwarf
  * Red Dwarf
  * Red Giant
  * Blue Giant
  * Super Giant
  * White Dwarf
  * Brown Dwarf
  * Neutron Star
  * Pulsar
  * Double Star
  * Binary Star

_Type doesn't currently have any in-game effect_

= Star System Map =

A star system's map is a polar map where entities occupy a position denoted by its orbit (distance from the star) and quadrant (1-4 representing North Easterly quadrant, South Easterly quadrant, South Westerly quadrant and North Westerly quadrant).

A star system's map is primarily vacuum but within it there may be:

  * [Planets]
  * [AsteroidField Asteroids]
  * [GasField Gas Fields]
  * [StellarAnomoly Anomolies]
