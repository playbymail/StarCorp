= Introduction =

Colony templates are used to generate colonies from the ServerShell.  They create a colony and assorted facilities (all owned by the same corporation) fitting a certain profile.  Useful for generating a functioning non-player game environment.

  * All templates contain a ColonyHub at the minimum.  
  * The colony is given enough population to run all facilities.
  * ServiceFacilities are added to meet current population needs.  Additional population is added to run these facilities.
  * The corporation is given enough power to run all facilities for 100 turns.
  * The colony market is given enough consumer needs for all colonists for 100 turns.
