= Introduction =

The Orbital Dock is a special facility type which allows [Starships] in [Orbiting orbit] of the colony's planet to transact with the ColonyMarkets.  Only 1 Orbital Dock may be built at each colony.

The orbital dock's service charge is a fee levied on all transactions with the ColonyMarkets done via orbit (in addition to any charge levied by the ColonyHub).

= Workers Required =

To operate at maximum efficiency an orbital dock requires: 5 x Technicians 10 x Drones 5 x Executives.

= Power Required =

An orbital dock uses 10 units of power per turn.

= Function / Efficiency =

== Colony Market Transactions ==

The number of transactions the dock can handle from orbit is determined by its current efficiency band:
  * 100%: 100000 transactions
  * 75-99%: 10000 transactions
  * 50-74%: 5000 transactions
  * 25-49%: 2500 transactions
  * 1-24%: 1000 transactions
  * 0%: 0 transactions
