= Selling =

Items must be located at the colony or on a starship either on the colony or interacting with the colony via an OrbitalDock.

A price per unit and quantity is specified when selling.  Items to be sold are removed from the corporation / starships inventory and added to the colony market.

= Buying =

Any listed item can be bought and either left in the colony or transported directly into a starship via an OrbitalDock.

When buying an item, the cheapest available item listed on the market is bought up to the quantity specified. [Credits] are transferred to the selling corporation upon sale.
